# Cache-Simulator-2
For my computer architecture class, I made a cache simulator to compare different cache configurations. A user can specify the number of sets, the number of blocks per set, the size of each block, and the replacement policy to use (First In First Out or Least Recently Used.) Our professor provided us with a trace file-- a record of accessed memory addresses-- that I have also included.

If you'd like to run this for yourself...\
-Be sure to have GNU's C++ compiler downloaded\
-Use the makefile for building the executable\
-To change the trace file, add your own into the /traces folder and update TRACE_FILE in main.cpp
