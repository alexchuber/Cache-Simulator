# Cache-Simulator-2
A cache simulator to compare different sizes, architectures, and replacement policies.
Specifically, the user can specify the number of sets, the number of blocks in a set, the size of each block, and the replacement policy to use (first-in-first-out or least recently used).

If you'd like to run this for yourself...\
-Be sure to have GNU's C++ compiler downloaded\
-A makefile is provided to help build the executable\
-To change the trace file, add your own into the /traces folder and update TRACE_FILE in main.cpp
